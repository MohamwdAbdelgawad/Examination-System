# Examination Management System

A console-based C# application demonstrating advanced OOP principles.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Arrays instead of List<T>
All internal collections use `T[]` with manual resize (doubling strategy), satisfying the constraint while keeping amortized O(1) add performance.

### 2. Inheritance & Polymorphism
- `Question` → `TrueFalseQuestion`, `ChooseOneQuestion`, `ChooseAllQuestion`
- `Exam` → `PracticeExam`, `FinalExam`
- `ShowExam()` and `CheckAnswer()` demonstrate runtime polymorphism.

### 3. Events & Delegates
`Exam.Mode` setter fires `ExamStarted` when set to `Starting`.  
`Subject.NotifyStudents()` subscribes each enrolled student's `OnExamStarted` handler before the exam starts — clean pub/sub separation.

### 4. Generics with Constraints
`Repository<T> where T : ICloneable, IComparable<T>` enforces cloneability and sortability. Used to store and sort `Exam` instances.

### 5. File I/O
`QuestionList` accepts a unique filename per instance via constructor. Every `Add()` call opens `StreamWriter` in append mode and logs question metadata. Each `QuestionList` writes to its own file.

### 6. IComparable / ICloneable
- `Answer` implements `IComparable<Answer>` by Id.
- `Exam` implements `ICloneable` (shallow clone) and `IComparable<Exam>` by Time then NumberOfQuestions.

### 7. ChooseAllQuestion
Stores a `CorrectAnswers[]` array. `CheckAnswers(Answer[])` sorts both arrays by Id then compares element-wise — correct set comparison regardless of selection order.

### 8. SOLID Principles
- **S** — Each class has a single clear responsibility.
- **O** — New exam types / question types extend existing abstractions.
- **L** — `PracticeExam` and `FinalExam` are substitutable for `Exam`.
- **I** — `ICloneable` and `IComparable` are minimal focused interfaces.
- **D** — `Exam` depends on `Subject` abstraction; event system decouples notification.
